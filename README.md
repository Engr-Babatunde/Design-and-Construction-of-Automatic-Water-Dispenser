# Design-and-Construction-of-Automatic-Water-Dispenser
**üìñ Introduction**

This project presents the design and construction of a microcontroller-based automatic water dispenser using an Arduino microcontroller. The system is capable of detecting the presence of a cup at a predetermined distance, dispensing water automatically, and stopping once the cup is at least 70% full or when the cup is removed.

To enhance user interaction, the dispenser is equipped with buzzers and LEDs to notify when a cup is detected and when it has been adequately filled. The Arduino microcontroller provides flexibility, allowing system modifications through software adjustments rather than hardware changes.

üéØ **Objectives**

Automate the process of water dispensing.

Ensure safe and hygienic dispensing by avoiding manual handling.

Notify users of cup presence and fill status.

Provide a flexible and easily modifiable system.

**üõ†Ô∏è Key Features**

Cup Detection: Detects the presence of a cup within a set range.

Smart Dispensing: Automatically stops at ~70% fill level or when the cup is removed.

Notifications: Buzzer and LEDs signal cup presence and water level status.

Flexibility: Arduino-based design allows easy modifications without hardware changes.
