# Design-and-Construction-of-Automatic-Water-Dispenser
This project presents the design and construction of a microcontroller-based automatic water dispenser using an Arduino microcontroller. The system is capable of detecting the presence of a cup at a predetermined distance, dispensing water automatically, and stopping once the cup is at least 70% full or when the cup is removed.
